Swish
=====

What is Swish?
--------------

Swish is a plugin for Microsoft Windows Explorer that adds support for SFTP.

If you've used Explorer's built-in FTP support, Swish is that but for SFTP
over SSH.

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
  * Windows 8     (most tested)
  * Windows 7     (occasionally tested)
  * Windows Vista (rarely tested)

Swish may also work on Windows XP, but we haven't tested that in a while.

Binaries
--------
Binary installers are [on our website](http://www.swish-sftp.org).

Getting involved
----------------
We welcome patches to help improve Swish.

Swish fetches almost all its dependencies when you configure it with [CMake].
That magic happens thanks to the [Hunter package manager].  However, you will
need Perl installed. [Strawberry Perl] is good, and available on [Chocolatey].

You'll also need a compiler (obviously), a recent version of the Windows SDK
and CMake.

### Why have an exception for OpenSSL?

The [OpenSSL] library is incompatible with the GPL license because it
contains an advertising clause.  However lots of useful, open source
software (including our own projects) need to use it and currently the
alternatives aren't quite up to scratch.  As we want these projects to
be able to reuse Washer, we have added this exception to the GPL - a
common technique used by other projects such as [wget].

If [GnuTLS] improves to the point where OpenSSL is no longer
necessary, we may remove this exception.
